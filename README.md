## Project description

This project exists as an exercise for learning `TDD(Test Driven Development)` and learning/brush up `data structures` fundamentals using `typescript`.

Here is a list of all data structures implemented so far:

- Stack
- Queue

Beside implementing each listed data structure, I apply them in some relevant(ðŸ¤”) use case. You should find each implementation under the `utils` folder.

And if you want to check the unit tests, they are in `tests/unit-tests`.

### Technologies

- Typescript
- Eslint and prettier (working together)
- Husky (pre-commit hook)
- Jest

### TO-DO ðŸ“‹

- [x] Add queues.
- [x] Add linked lists.
- [ ] Add circular lists.
- [ ] Add double linked lists.
- [ ] ...
